  <p>Structurally Insulated Panelized walls are the modern replacement for outdated traditional framing and wall construction techniques.</p>
  <p>Panelized walls are made from an insulated layer sandwiched between two structural outer layers that ensure comfortable temperatures control no matter the time of year.</p>
  <p>Not all building materials are equal. We manufacture our walls using expanded polystyrene (EPS) cores and fibre cement outer layers, making them fire, mold, water, impact-resistant, and exceptionally insulated.</p>
  <p>The construction and design of our walls allow for complete, continuous insulation throughout your home, which will not sag or degrade over time like many other insulation materials.</p>
  <p>By providing a thermal comfort with a high energy efficiency that delivers higher cost saving, this applications on this new methods are endless for new builds</p>
