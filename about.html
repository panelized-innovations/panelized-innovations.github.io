  <h2>About Panelized Innovations</h2>
  <img src="images/about1.jpg" alt="Panelized Innovations" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; margin-bottom:20px;">
  <p>Structurally Insulated Panelized walls are the modern replacement for outdated traditional framing and wall construction techniques. Panelized walls are made from an insulated layer sandwiched between two structural outer layers that ensure comfortable temperatures no matter the time of year.</p>
  <p>Not all building materials are equal. We manufacture our walls using expanded polystyrene (EPS) cores and fibre cement outer layers, making them fire-resistant, mold-resistant, water-resistant, impact-resistant, and exceptionally insulated.</p>
  <p>The construction and design of our walls allow for complete, continuous insulation throughout your home, which will not sag or degrade over time like many other insulation materials.</p>
